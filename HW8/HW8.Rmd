7.2 Question 10
Since the 100 lightbulbs are independent random variables the density is exponential with mean 1000/100. SO we would expect the first bulb to last 10 hours.

7.2 Question 14


8.1 - Question 1
If the mean is 10 and a standard deviation is 100/3 the upper bound is:
P(|X - 10| >2) < (100/3)/4
P(|X - 10| >5) < (100/3)/25
P(|X - 10| >9) < (100/3)/81
P(|X - 10| >20) < (100/3)/400
